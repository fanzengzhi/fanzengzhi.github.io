This is a personal blog of Fan Zengzhi.

I am working at Hangzhou, China. I was a game programmer for NetEase and am now a 3D engine programmer for Alibaba.

I've participated a game project, and the game <无尽战区·觉醒> was released in March, 2017. I mainly worked on rendering techniques and 3D related application developments.
